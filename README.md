# MEdiScript - LLM-Based Doctor-Patient Q&A System for e-Health Records

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
This repository will host an LLM-based project designed to enhance doctor-patient interactions by converting voice conversations into structured e-Health records. The system will perform speech recognition, text processing, and keyword analysis to accurately fill out e-Health forms used by hospitals.

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an advanced system that streamlines the process of recording doctor-patient conversations into electronic health records (EHR). The system will:

* Convert Voice to Text: Use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe conversations between doctors and patients.
* Keyword Extraction & Classification: Process the transcribed text to identify key information such as patient complaints, diagnoses, and recommended treatments.
* EHR Integration: Automatically fill in the appropriate fields in the hospital's e-Health record system based on the extracted data.

## Planned Features
1. Speech Recognition: Leveraging state-of-the-art ASR models to accurately transcribe conversations.
2. Natural Language Processing: Using a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze and classify text data.
3. EHR Form Integration: Mapping conversation data to the correct fields in an e-Health record form.
4. User Interface: A web-based UI to allow medical professionals to interact with the system, review transcriptions, and make necessary edits.

## Technologies
1. ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition): To convert doctor-patient conversations into text.
2. Large Language Models (LLMs): For processing and classifying text data.
3. Python: Backend implementation of the ASR and text classifier.
4. Web Technologies: For creating a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers.

# Current Status
This project is currently in the early stages of development. Key milestones will be shared in this repository as the project progresses.

To-Do List
- [ ] Implement ASR module for voice-to-text conversion.
- [ ] Develop the LLM-based text processing and classification system.
- [ ] Integrate the processed data into a structured e-Health record form.
- [ ] Build the web UI for interaction with the system.
- [ ]  Conduct testing and validation with real-world data.
